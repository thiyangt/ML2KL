Sri Lanka has a rich history of blending mathematics and art, especially in its ancient architecture, wall paintings, frescoes and murals.   This study investigates the potential of machine learning to reveal mathematical patterns concealed in ancient paintings and artifacts. 


Figures 1 to 5 show some Sri Lankan wall paintings and artefacts embedded with mathematical principles such as geometry, tessellation, symmetry, coloring algorithms, motifs, and more. This further reinforces my belief: Behind every mathematician lies an artist, and behind every artist lies a mathematician.
