Sri Lanka is a country with a rich cultural heritage. As both a Data Scientist and an Artist, observing the artifacts, historical paintings, and murals of our ancient kingdoms made me realize that these are not merely artistic expressions—they are deeply rooted in mathematical principles. This reinforces my belief: Behind every mathematician, there is an artist, and behind every artist, there is a mathematician.

Figures 1 to 5 showcase examples from historical sites, featuring wall paintings and wooden carvings that I believe are grounded in mathematical concepts. When viewed from a mathematician’s perspective, these artworks reveal principles such as geometry, tessellation, symmetry, coloring algorithms, motifs, and more.

The goal of this research is to explore mathematical concepts embedded in artifacts and historical paintings through the lens of machine learning.
