Sri Lanka is a country with a rich cultural heritage. Being a Data Scientist and an Artist, observing the artifacts, historical paintings, and murals of our ancient kingdoms made me realize that these are not merely artistic choicesâ€”they are deeply rooted in mathematical principles. This reinforces my belief: **Behind every mathematician, there is an artist, and behind every artist, there is a mathematician**. 

Below are some examples from our historical sites that illustrate this idea:
