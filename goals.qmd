---

## 1. Collect and digitize ancient Sri Lankan wall paintings and artifacts to build a comprehensive and accessible database

-   SDG 4 (Quality Education): Open-access digital archives support research and education.

-   SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure): Create an atlas of mathematics rooted artifact locations to boost tourism industry

-   SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities & Communities): Preserves Sri Lankan heritage for future generations.

-   SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production): Digital preservation and machine learning modeling minimize the need for physical interventions, reducing material waste and costs.

## 2. Develop an algorithm to enhance image quality for analysis

-   SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure): AI-driven restoration aids cultural conservation.

## 3. Create machine learning models to identify mathematical patterns such as symmetry, tessellation, the golden ratio, geometries, motif and coloring algorithms rooted in historical paintings and artifacts

-   SDG 4 (Quality Education): Encourages interdisciplinary learning in mathematics, art, and data science.

-   SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure): Bridges historical art and modern technology.

-   SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities): Uncovering mathematical patterns and structures in artifacts enhances their global recognition, attracting a wider audience and boosting cultural tourism. This method can also be used as a way to authenticate our artifacts.

## 4. Develop a classification algorithm to determine the historical period of artifacts and paintings.

-   SDG 9 (Industry & Innovation): Enables data science powered cultural research.

-   SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities & Communities): Digital classification helps heritage conservation efforts.

-   SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals): Encourages collaborations between data scientists, historians, and cultural institutions

## 5. Produce a documentary highlighting these discoveries to promote tourism and engage a broader audience. Additionally, develop open-access online books that integrate mathematics and programming with art, fostering mathematical education. Create mandala designs inspired by traditional Sri Lankan art to enhance mathematical thinking in a stress-relieving and creative way

-   SDG 4 (Education & Awareness): Enhances STEM + Art (STEAM) learning by integrating history, art, mathematics and data science.
