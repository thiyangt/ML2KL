## About

This research project is a new journey from **Machine Learning to Kingdom Learning** with **M**athematics, **A**rt and **D**ata **S**cience (**MADS**), exploring mathematical concepts embedded in historical paintings and their evolution across different kingdoms in Sri Lanka.

This research strongly aligns with the 2025 International Day of Mathematics theme: Mathematics, Art, and Creativity, emphasizing the importance of the intersection between mathematics and art.
