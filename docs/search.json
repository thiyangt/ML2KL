    "text": "Sri Lanka has a rich history of blending mathematics and art, especially in its ancient architecture, wall paintings, frescoes and murals. This study investigates the potential of machine learning to reveal mathematical patterns concealed in ancient paintings and artifacts.\nFigures 1 to 5 show some Sri Lankan wall paintings and artefacts embedded with mathematical principles such as geometry, tessellation, symmetry, coloring algorithms, motifs, and more. This further reinforces my belief: Behind every mathematician lies an artist, and behind every artist lies a mathematician.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa): Tunnel to Sri Dalada Maligawa painted with lotus flower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa): Tunnel to Sri Dalada Maligawa painted with lotus flower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Embekka Devalaya was built by the King Vikramabahu III of Gampola Era in Sri Lanka\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Embekka Devalaya was built by the King Vikramabahu III of Gampola Era in Sri Lanka"
