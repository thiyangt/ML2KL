    "text": "Sri Lanka has a rich history of blending mathematics and art, especially in its ancient architecture, wall paintings, frescoes and murals. The main goal of this project is to develop machine learning algorithms to uncover mathematical concepts rooted in historical paintings and artefacts of Sri Lanka.\nFigures 1 to 5 show some Sri Lankan wall paintings and artefacts embedded with mathematical principles such as geometry, tessellation, symmetry, coloring algorithms, and motif. Clearly, these elements are not just artistic choices but are deeply rooted in mathematics. This further reinforces my belief: behind every mathematician there is an artist, and behind every artist there is a mathematician.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa): Tunnel to Sri Dalada Maligawa painted with lotus flower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa): Tunnel to Sri Dalada Maligawa painted with lotus flower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Embekka Devalaya was built by the King Vikramabahu III of Gampola Era in Sri Lanka\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Embekka Devalaya was built by the King Vikramabahu III of Gampola Era in Sri Lanka"

Talagala, Department of Statistics, Faculty of Applied Sciences, University of Sri Jayewardenepura\nSri Lanka is home to a rich cultural heritage, including vibrant ancient wall paintings. However, limited research has applied data science to analyze these artistic treasures. This study investigates variations in color palettes across different historical kingdoms using machine learning. Digital images of wall paintings were collected from Kandy, Dambulla, and Sigiriya. Hexadecimal color values were extracted from each image to quantify the dominant hues. A supervised machine learning algorithm was then trained to classify paintings based on their respective kingdoms using color patterns. The model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting the kingdoms. This research provides new insights into the artistic evolution of ancient wall paintings."
