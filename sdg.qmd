Research plays a vital role in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

## SDG 4: Quality Education

### Contribution: Enhances STEM + Art (STEAM) learning by integrating history, art and mathematics

1.  Create online open-access books that integrate mathematics and programming with art to promote mathematics among creative and artistically talented individuals.

2.  Create an open-access digital archives support research and education

3.  Generate mandala inspired by traditional Sri Lankan art which helps to improve mathematical thinking in stress relieving way.

## SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure

### Contribution: Enhance scientific research and technological capabilities in industrial sector

1.  This study leverages advanced computational techniques to analyze the evolution of artistic styles, integrating machine learning to drive innovation in the craft and creative industries.
2.  Create an atlas of mathematics rooted artifact locations to boost tourism industry.

## SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

### Contribution: Strengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the worldâ€™s cultural and natural heritage

1.  Open-access digital archives to preserve wall paintings and artifacts, ensuring their longevity while fostering cultural awareness and appreciation.

2.  Uncovering mathematical patterns and structures in artifacts enhances their global recognition, attracting a wider audience and boosting cultural tourism.

## SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

### Contribution: Reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, and reuse strategies

1.  Digital preservation and machine learning modeling minimize the need for physical interventions, reducing material waste and costs.

## SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals

### Contribution: Encourages collaborations between AI researchers, historians, and cultural institutions.
